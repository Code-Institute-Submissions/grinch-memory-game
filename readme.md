 ## Testing

 The testing process consists of opening the game on different devices, checking there are no errors, checking responsible design,  and if all programmed functions are executed correctly.
 Below are all the devices used for this testing process:

 1. Home Page:
    1. Click on the button 'instructions' and check to see Modal appears in centre screen.
    2. Check if a click on any part of screen away from Modal to close Modal.
    3. Check if 'Close' buttton on Modal closes Modal and returns user to Home screen.
    4. Check if 'Play' buttton brings user to 'index.html' page and activates the game. 
    
2. index.html:
    1. Click on card, make sure flip animation takes place. 
    2. Try click on same card again to make sure that JavaScript prevents from reflipping already chosen card. 
    3. Try and click on three cards in rapid succession to make sure game 'freezes' board to prevent such an action.
    4. Make sure that if second card is selected is wrong, both cards re-flip themselves while 'flip' counter adds 1 to scoreboard. 
    5. Makfesure that if second card is selected is correct, both cards stay flipped while both the 'flip' and 'Score' counter add 1 to their respective total amounts.
    6. Clicking on the 'Reset' button will shuffle back all the cards and reset both counters.

3. Check that the game looks and runs well on both responsive windows aswell as mobile device viewports provided by the Chrome Developer tools. 
  The game's responsiveness has also been tested on the following devices
